	abstract = {This statement summarises and appraises the evidence on diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the most common lower extremity muscle injuries in sport. We systematically searched electronic databases, and included studies based on the highest available evidence. Subsequently, we evaluated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework, grading the quality of evidence from high to very low. Most clinical tests showed very low to low diagnostic effectiveness. For hamstring injury prevention, programmes that included the Nordic hamstring exercise resulted in a hamstring injury risk reduction when compared with usual care (medium to large effect size; moderate to high quality of evidence). For prevention of groin injuries, both the FIFA 11+programme and the Copenhagen adductor strengthening programme resulted in a groin injury risk reduction compared with usual care (medium effect size; low to moderate quality of evidence). For the treatment of hamstring injuries, lengthening hamstring exercises showed the fastest return to play with a lower reinjury rate compared with conventional hamstring exercises (large effect size; very low to low quality of evidence). Platelet-rich plasma had no effect on time to return-to-play and reinjury risk (trivial effect size; moderate quality of evidence) after a hamstring injury compared with placebo or rehabilitation. At this point, most outcomes for diagnosis, prevention and treatment were graded as very low to moderate quality of evidence, indicating that further high-quality research is likely to have an important impact on the confidence in the effect estimates.},

	abstract = {There is no agreement on how to classify, define or diagnose hip-related pain-a common cause of hip and groin pain in young and middle-aged active adults. This complicates the work of clinicians and researchers. The International Hip-related Pain Research Network consensus group met in November 2018 in Zurich aiming to make recommendations on how to classify, define and diagnose hip disease in young and middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain as the main symptom. Prior to the meeting we performed a scoping review of electronic databases in June 2018 to determine the definition, epidemiology and diagnosis of hip conditions in young and middle-aged active adults presenting with hip-related pain. We developed and presented evidence-based statements for these to a panel of 37 experts for discussion and consensus agreement. Both non-musculoskeletal and serious hip pathological conditions (eg, tumours, infections, stress fractures, slipped capital femoral epiphysis), as well as competing musculoskeletal conditions (eg, lumbar spine) should be excluded when diagnosing hip-related pain in young and middle-aged active adults. The most common hip conditions in young and middle-aged active adults presenting with hip-related pain are: (1) femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome, (2) acetabular dysplasia and/or hip instability and (3) other conditions without a distinct osseous morphology (labral, chondral and/or ligamentum teres conditions), and that these terms are used in research and clinical practice. Clinical examination and diagnostic imaging have limited diagnostic utility; a comprehensive approach is therefore essential. A negative flexion-adduction-internal rotation test helps rule out hip-related pain although its clinical utility is limited. Anteroposterior pelvis and lateral femoral head-neck radiographs are the initial diagnostic imaging of choice-advanced imaging should be performed only when requiring additional detail of bony or soft-tissue morphology (eg, for definitive diagnosis, research setting or when planning surgery). We recommend clear, detailed and consistent methodology of bony morphology outcome measures (definition, measurement and statistical reporting) in research. Future research on conditions with hip-related pain as the main symptom should include high-quality prospective studies on aetiology and prognosis. The most common hip conditions in active adults presenting with hip-related pain are: (1) FAI syndrome, (2) acetabular dysplasia and/or hip instability and (3) other conditions without distinct osseous morphology including labral, chondral and/or ligamentum teres conditions. The last category should not be confused with the incidental imaging findings of labral, chondral and/or ligamentum teres pathology in asymptomatic people. Future research should refine our current recommendations by determining the clinical utility of clinical examination and diagnostic imaging in prospective studies.},

High adductor muscle activity has been shown in the Copenhagen Adduction exercise (CA); however, an associated strength gain has not been investigated. This study aims to examine the eccentric hip adduction strength (EHAD) gain using the CA in-season. Two U-19 sub-elite football teams, including 24 football players, were randomized to either an 8-week supervised progressive training program in addition to the usual training (intervention) or to continue training as usual (control). EHAD, eccentric hip abduction strength (EHAB), and side-bridge endurance were measured using reliable test procedures at baseline and follow-up by a blinded tester. There was a significant interaction between group and time on EHAD, EHAB, and EHAD/EHAB ratio (P {\textless} 0.025). The intervention group demonstrated a 35.7\% increase in EHAD (P {\textless} 0.001); a 20.3\% increase in EHAB (P = 0.003), and 12.3\% increase in EHAD/EHAB ratio (P = 0.019). No significant within-group differences were found in the control group (P {\textgreater} 0.335). Compliance was 91.25\%, and median muscle soreness ranged from 0 to 2. The CA implemented in-season with an 8-week progressive training program elicited a large significant increase in EHAD, EHAB, and EHAD/EHAB ratio.},

We found 29 studies reporting 23 clinical tests and 14 different forms of clinical information, respectively. Restricted internal hip rotation in 0° hip flexion with or without pain was best to rule in FAI syndrome (low diagnostic effectiveness; low quality of evidence; interpretation of evidence: may increase post-test probability slightly), whereas no pain in Flexion Adduction Internal Rotation test or no restricted range of motion in Flexion Abduction External Rotation test compared with the unaffected side were best to rule out (very low to high diagnostic effectiveness; very low to moderate quality of evidence; interpretation of evidence: very uncertain, but may reduce post-test probability slightly). No forms of clinical information were found useful for diagnosis. For treatment of FAI syndrome, 14 randomised controlled trials were found. Prescribed physiotherapy, consisting of hip strengthening, hip joint manual therapy techniques, functional activity-specific retraining and education showed a small to medium effect size compared with a combination of passive modalities, stretching and advice (very low to low quality of evidence; interpretation of evidence: very uncertain, but may slightly improve outcomes). Prescribed physiotherapy was, however, inferior to hip arthroscopy (small effect size; moderate quality of evidence; interpretation of evidence: hip arthroscopy probably increases outcome slightly). For both domains, the overall quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate indicating that future research on diagnosis and treatment may alter the conclusions from this review.},

	abstract = {Hip-related pain is a well-recognised complaint among active young and middle-aged active adults. People experiencing hip-related disorders commonly report pain and reduced functional capacity, including difficulties in executing activities of daily living. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are essential to accurately examine and compare the effects of different treatments on disability in those with hip pain. In November 2018, 38 researchers and clinicians working in the field of hip-related pain met in Zurich, Switzerland for the first International Hip-related Pain Research Network meeting. Prior to the meeting, evidence summaries were developed relating to four prioritised themes. This paper discusses the available evidence and consensus process from which recommendations were made regarding the appropriate use of PROMs to assess disability in young and middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain. Our process to gain consensus had five steps: (1) systematic review of systematic reviews; (2) preliminary discussion within the working group; (3) update of the more recent high-quality systematic review and examination of the psychometric properties of PROMs according to established guidelines; (4) formulation of the recommendations considering the limitations of the PROMs derived from the examination of their quality; and (5) voting and consensus. Out of 102 articles retrieved, 6 systematic reviews were selected and assessed for quality according to AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews). Two showed moderate quality. We then updated the most recent review. The updated literature search resulted in 10 additional studies that were included in the qualitative synthesis. The recommendations based on evidence summary and PROMs limitations were presented at the consensus meeting. The group makes the following recommendations: (1) the Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) and the International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT) instruments (long and reduced versions) are the most appropriate PROMs to use in young and middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain; (2) more research is needed into the utility of the HAGOS and the iHOT instruments in a non-surgical treatment context; and (3) generic quality of life measures such as the EuroQoL-5 Dimension Questionnaire and the Short Form Health Survey-36 may add value for researchers and clinicians in this field. We conclude that as none of the instruments shows acceptable quality across various psychometric properties, more methods studies are needed to further evaluate the validity of these PROMS-the HAGOS and iHOT-as well as the other (currently not recommended) PROMS.},

Thirty-eight expert researchers and clinicians working in the field of hip-related pain attended the meeting. This manuscript relates to the theme of physiotherapist-led treatments for hip-related pain. A systematic review on the efficacy of physiotherapist-led interventions for hip-related pain (published separately) was conducted and found that strong evidence for physiotherapist-led treatments was lacking. Prior to the meeting, draft consensus recommendations for consideration in the meeting were also developed based on the systematic review. The draft consensus recommendations were presented to all of the meeting participants via email, at least 1 week prior to the meeting. At the meeting, these recommendations were discussed, revised and voted on. Six recommendations for clinical practice and five recommendations for research were included and all gained consensus. Recommendations for clinical practice were that (i) Exercise-based treatments are recommended for people with hip-related pain. (ii) Exercise-based treatment should be at least 3 months duration. (iii) Physiotherapist-led rehabilitation after hip surgery should be undertaken. (iv) Patient-reported outcome measures, measures of physical impairment and measures of psychosocial factors should be used to monitor response to treatment. (v) Physical activity (that may include sport) is recommended for people with hip-related pain. (vi) Clinicians should discuss patient expectations, use shared-decision making and provide education. Recommendations for research were (i) Reporting of exercise programmes: Exercise descriptors such as load magnitude, number of repetitions and sets, duration of whole programme, duration of contractile element of exercise, duration of one repetition, time under tension, rest between repetitions, range of motion through which the exercise is performed, and rest between exercise sessions should be reported. (ii) Research should investigate the optimal frequency, intensity, time, type, volume and progression of exercise therapy. (iii) Research should examine the effect of patient education in people with hip-related pain. (iv) Research should investigate the effect of other treatments used in people with hip-related pain (for example: manual therapy, medications, injections). (v) Research should examine the impact of comorbidities and social determinants on treatment effectiveness in people with hip-related pain. Clinicians and researchers working with young to middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain may use these consensus recommendations to guide, develop, test and implement individualised, evidence-based physiotherapist-led rehabilitation programmes.},

	abstract = {Hip-related pain can significantly impact quality of life, function, work capacity, physical activity and family life. Standardised measurement methods of physical capacity of relevance to young and middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain are currently not established. The aim of this consensus paper was to provide recommendations for clinical practice and research on standardised measurement methods of physical capacity in young and middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain. Four areas of importance were identified: (1) clinical measures (range of motion, muscle strength, functional impairments), (2) laboratory-based measures (biomechanics and muscle function (muscle activity, size and adiposity)), (3) physical activity, and (4) return to sport/performance. The literature was reviewed, and a summary circulated to the working group to inform discussion at the consensus meeting. The working group developed clinical and research recommendations from the literature review, which were further discussed and modified within the working group at the consensus meeting. These recommendations were then presented to all 38 International Hip-related Pain Research Network (IHiPRN) participants for further discussion, refinement and consensus voting. Therefore, the recommendations voted on were based on a combination of current evidence and expert opinion. The consensus meeting voted on 13 recommendations, six of which were clinically orientated, and seven more research specific. We recommended that clinicians working with young and middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain assess strength using objective methods of measurement, and clinically assess performance of functional tasks, including walking and running. Physical activity should be quantified using both self-reported and objective measures, and patient expectations of recovery should be quantified prior to treatment. It was recommended that return to physical activity (including sport and occupation) be quantified, and sport-specific activities should be assessed prior to return to sport. The IHiPRN participants were uncertain regarding recommendations for range of motion assessment. Research recommendations were that the measurement properties of range of motion, strength and functional performance tests be investigated, reported and improved in both clinical and research settings. Reporting of movement-related parameters (biomechanics and muscle function) should be standardised and the relationship among movement-related parameters, symptoms, function, quality of life, and intra-articular and imaging findings should be investigated. Quantification of return to physical activity (including sport and occupational demands) is required in future research, and the return to sport continuum should be used. Future research is required to determine the best criteria for rehabilitation progression and return to physical activity following hip-related pain management.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Previous studies showed that the Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE) effectively prevents primary hamstring injury. However, no study investigated the secondary preventing effect of the NHE on hamstring reinjury. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the NHE for preventing hamstring reinjury after return to play (RTP) following a hamstring injury in football players. The secondary purpose is to determine the effect of the NHE on sprint and jump performance.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an international multicentre, prospective, parallel-group randomised controlled trial study. Subjects include male or female football players aged 18-40 years and within 1 week of RTP following a hamstring injury will be randomised into Nordics or a control group. Subjects in both groups continue their regular football training, but the Nordics group will perform an additional NHE programme. An online questionnaire will be sent to the subjects in both groups once per week within the first 10 weeks, then continued at months 6, 9 and 12. In a (performance) substudy, we will evaluate the effect of the NHE on sprint and vertical jump performance at three time points (at the beginning of the study, after 10 weeks and 12 months of follow-up).The primary outcomes are the incidence of hamstring reinjury within 2 and 12 months. The secondary outcomes are sprint and jump performance, adherence to the programme, duration of reinjury and reinjury burden.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by the medical ethics committee of Amsterdam University Medical Center (UMC) in the Netherlands (METC 2021\_117), Faculty of Medicine Universitas Gadjah Mada in Indonesia (KE/FK/1248/EC/2021), Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Norway (number 216-2 70 122) and Denmark (ethical submission in process). The study's findings will be disseminated in scientific peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical examination of male football players with longstanding groin pain can be considered difficult. Pain provocation tests are used to examine and classify longstanding groin pain into clinical entities as adductor-, iliopsoas-, inguinal-, and pubic-related. It is unknown if pain provocation tests and clinical entities are associated with pain intensity and disability.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate if the number of positive pain provocation tests and clinical entities are associated with pain intensity and disability, measured by the Copenhagen 5-Second Squeeze Test (5SST) and the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS), respectively.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
METHOD: Forty male football players (age: mean 24 years [SD: 3.2]; height: mean 182 cm [SD: 5.7]; weight: mean 78 Kg [SD: 6.6]) with longstanding groin pain for a median of 8.5 months (IQR: 4-36) were included. The players underwent a bilateral groin examination with 33 pain provocation tests and were classified with clinical entities (0-7) based on the test findings.
RESULTS: The number of positive pain provocation tests (median 10, range 2-23) correlated with pain intensity (5SST: rs = 0.70 [95\% CI: 0.50, 0.83]) and disability (HAGOS subscales Sport: rs =-0.62 [95\% CI: -0.81, -0.36], Pain: rs = -0.38 [95\% CI: -0.69, -0.06], Symptoms: rs = 0.52 [95\% CI: -0.73, -0.24], ADL: rs = -0.48 [95\% CI: -0.71, -0.18]). The number of clinical entities (median 3, range: 1-7) showed similar but weaker correlations to pain intensity and disability.
CONCLUSIONS: In male football players with longstanding groin pain, the number of positive pain provocation tests and clinical entities shows weak to strong correlations with pain intensity and disability. Consequently, when pain intensity and disability are severe, a higher number of pain provocation tests may be positive, and more clinical entities may be present.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the differences in hip adductor and abductor muscle strength in elite male footballers from youth to senior level.
METHODS: We tested 125 players from the under-13-years (U'13) to senior squads of a Danish male professional football club in this cross-sectional design study. Hip adductor and abductor force (in newtons), torque (in newton meters), normalized torque (in newton meters per body mass), and adduction-to-abduction ratio were measured using handheld dynamometry.
RESULTS: Between U'13 and senior level, adductor force increased by 104\%, torque by 127\%, and normalized torque by 21\%. Abductor force increased by 78\%, torque by 126\%, and normalized torque by 17\%. For incremental differences between age groups, significant increases were observed between the ages of U'13 to U'14 (18\%-39\%) and U'14 to U'15 (19\%-33\%) for all strength measures (P ≤ .021). No incremental difference was observed for adductor-to-abductor ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: The large increases in hip adductor and abductor strength occurring between the ages of U'13 and U'15 offer insight into the strength capabilities and stress demands in these players, which may relate to injury vulnerability, and facilitate clinicians in selecting best-suited exercise interventions.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Pre-season testing at facilities of a Danish professional 1st tier soccer club and academy.
PARTICIPANTS: Elite male soccer players (n = 83, mean age; 16 ± 2.7 years) from U13, U14, U15, U17, U19 and senior teams cleared for full training and match participation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maximum isometric hip adduction strength (Nm/kg) and provoked groin pain (NRS 0-10).
RESULTS: Hip adduction strength was 16\% lower in the ForceFrame. A Bland-Altman plot showed a systematic bias (-0.47 Nm/kg, 95\% CI [-0.57; -0.38]) and lack of agreement (95\% limits of agreement: -1.31; 0.39 Nm/kg). In the ForceFrame, provoked groin pain was less intense (median NRS 0 [IQR: 0-1] vs. 5SST: 1 [IQR: 0-3], p {\textless} 0.001) and reported by fewer players (NRS {\textgreater}0) (27\% [n = 22] vs. 5SST: 61.4\% [n = 51], p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The ForceFrame and the 5SST lack agreement and are not interchangeable methods. This may have implications when selecting a method for screening and detecting early groin problems in male soccer players.},

However, the existing body of evidence is mainly based on experienced participants; therefore, the injury incidence and injury rate within novice CrossFit participants remains relatively unknown. The aim of this study wasto investigate the injury incidence and injury rate among novice participants in an eight-week CrossFit program.
METHODS: This survey-based prospective cohort study included CrossFit Copenhagen's novice members who began an eight-week, free-of-charge membership period. A questionnaire was distributed at baseline and at eight-week follow-up. Information about exposure was retrieved through the online booking system. Injury incidence, defined as proportion of participants who sustained an injury, and injury rates per 1000 h of exposure were calculated.
RESULTS: Among the 168 included participants, a total of 28 injuries (14.9\%) were reported. The number of injured participants and total exposure time resulted in an injury rate per 1000 h of exposure of 9.5.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the existing body of evidence, the findings in this study indicate that the risk of injuries is higher among novice participants than among experienced CrossFit participants.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Increasing age, high quadriceps strength, and low hamstring muscle strength are associated with hamstring strain injury in soccer. The authors investigated the age-related variation in maximal hamstring and quadriceps strength in male elite soccer players from under-13 (U-13) to the senior level.
METHODS: A total of 125 elite soccer players were included from a Danish professional soccer club and associated youth academy (first tier; U-13, n = 19; U-14, n = 16; U-15, n = 19; U-17, n = 24; U-19, n = 17; and senior, n = 30). Maximal voluntary isometric force was assessed for the hamstrings at 15° knee joint angle and for the quadriceps at 60° knee joint angle (0° = full extension) using an external-fixated handheld dynamometer. Hamstring-to-quadriceps strength (H:Q) ratio and hamstring and quadriceps maximal voluntary isometric force levels were compared across age groups (U-13 to senior).
RESULTS: Senior players showed 18\% to 26\% lower H:Q ratio compared with all younger age groups (P ≤ .026). Specific H:Q ratios (mean [95\% confidence interval]) were as follows: senior, 0.45 (0.42-0.48); U-19, 0.61 (0.55-0.66); U-17, 0.56 (0.51-0.60); U-15, 0.59 (0.54-0.64); U-14, 0.54 (0.50-0.59); and U-13, 0.57 (0.51-0.62). Hamstring strength increased from U-13 to U-19 with a significant drop from U-19 to the senior level (P = .048), whereas quadriceps strength increased gradually from U-13 to senior level.
CONCLUSION: Elite senior soccer players demonstrate lower H:Q ratio compared with youth players, which is driven by lower hamstring strength at the senior level compared with the U-19 level combined with a higher quadriceps strength. This discrepancy in hamstring and quadriceps strength capacity may place senior-level players at increased risk of hamstring muscle strain injuries.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Reduced sports function is often observed after hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS). Impaired muscle strength could be reasons for this. We aimed to investigate hip muscle strength after hip arthroscopy for FAIS and its association with sports function and participation.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: We included 45 patients (34 males; mean age: 30.6 ± 5.9 years) after unilateral hip arthroscopy for FAIS (mean follow-up [range]: 19.3 [9.8-28.4] months). Maximal isometric hip muscle strength (Nm/kg) including early- (0-100 ms) and late-phase (0-200 ms) rate of torque development (Nm∗kg-1∗s-1) for adduction, abduction, flexion, and extension was measured with an externally fixated handheld dynamometer and compared between operated and non-operated hip. Associations between muscle strength and self-reported sports function and return to sport were investigated.
RESULTS: For maximal hip muscle strength, no between-hip differences were observed for adduction, abduction, flexion, and extension (p ≥ 0.102). For rate of torque development, significantly lower values were observed for the operated hip in flexion at both 0-100 ms (mean difference: 1.58 Nm∗kg-1∗s-1, 95\% CI [0.39; 2.77], p = 0.01) and 0-200 ms (mean difference: 0.72 Nm∗kg-1∗s-1, 95\% CI [0.09; 1.35], p = 0.027). Higher maximal hip extension strength was significantly associated with greater ability to participate fully in preinjury sport at preinjury level (odds ratio: 17.71 95\% CI [1.77; 177.60]).
CONCLUSIONS: After hip arthroscopy for FAIS subjects show limited impairments in maximal and explosive hip muscle strength between operated and non-operated hip. Higher muscle strength was positively associated with higher sports function and ability to participate in sport.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hip arthroscopy is a viable treatment for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS). Clinically relevant improvements in hip function and pain after surgery are often reported, but it is less clear how many patients achieve an acceptable symptom state (Patient Acceptable Symptom State [PASS]).
PURPOSE: To investigate the proportion of patients who achieved a PASS 12 to 24 months after hip arthroscopy and to determine the cutoff scores of the 2 recommended and valid patient-reported outcome measures (the subscales of the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score [HAGOS] and the International Hip Outcome Tool-33 [iHOT-33]) for which patients are most likely to achieve PASS.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: Eligible study patients were identified in the Danish Hip Arthroscopy Registry. An electronic questionnaire was used to collect data on PASS, HAGOS, and iHOT-33 12 to 24 months after surgery. PASS was measured using an anchor question. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were applied to identify the PASS cutoff values of HAGOS and iHOT-33 scores.
RESULTS: A total of 137 individuals (mean age at surgery, 35.4 ± 9.4 years) were included in the study at a mean follow-up of 18.5 ± 3.2 months after surgery. At follow-up, 64 individuals (46.7\%; 95\% CI, 38.6-55.1) reported PASS. Higher HAGOS and iHOT-33 values were observed for participants who reported PASS compared with those who did not report PASS (Cohen d ≥ 1.06; P {\textless} .001). Cutoff scores for HAGOS subscales (42.5-82.5) and iHOT-33 (67.00) showed excellent to outstanding discriminative ability in predicting PASS (area under the curve, 0.82-0.92).
CONCLUSION: In total, 46\% of individuals having hip arthroscopy for FAIS achieved PASS at 12 to 24 months of follow-up. Patients who achieved PASS had statistically significant and substantially better self-reported hip function compared with those who did not achieve PASS. Cutoff values at HAGOS subscales and iHOT-33 showed excellent to outstanding discriminative ability in predicting patients with PASS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hamstring strain injuries are common in many sports. Following a hamstring injury, deficits in peak and explosive strength may persist after return to sport potentially affecting sprint performance. Assessment of repeated-sprint ability is recognized as an important part of the return to sport evaluation after a hamstring injury.Purpose: This purpose of this exploratory cross-sectional study was to compare sprinting performance obtained during a repeated-sprint test between football players with and without a previous hamstring strain injury.
METHODS: Forty-four fully active sub-elite football players, 11 with a previous hamstring strain injury during the preceding 12 months (cases; mean age, SD: 25.6 ± 4.4) and 33 demographically similar controls (mean age, SD: 23.2 ± 3.7), were included from six clubs. All players underwent a repeated-sprint test, consisting of six 30-meter maximal sprints with 90 seconds of recovery between sprints. Sprint performance was captured using high-speed video-recording and subsequently assessed by a blinded tester to calculate maximal sprint velocity, maximal horizontal force, maximal horizontal power, and mechanical effectiveness.
RESULTS: A significant between-group difference was seen in favor of players having a previous hamstring injury over 6 sprints for maximal velocity (mean difference: 0.457 m/s, 95\% CI: 0.059-0.849, p = 0.025) and mechanical effectiveness (mean difference: 0.009, 95\% CI: 0.001-0.016, p = 0.020).
CONCLUSION: Repeated-sprint performance was not impaired in football players with a previous hamstring strain injury; in fact, higher mean maximal sprinting velocity and better mechanical effectiveness were found in players with compared to without a previous hamstring injury. The higher sprinting velocity, which likely increases biomechanical load on the hamstring muscles, in previously injured players may increase the risk of recurrent injuries.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hip adduction and abduction muscle function plays an important role for risk of groin pain in athletes. Maximal isometric strength can be obtained clinically using a handheld dynamometer. However, in very strong athletes this is challenging, as external fixation of the dynamometer is needed for reliable measures. An alternative to unilateral testing, is the long-lever hip adduction squeeze test and a novel bilateral hip abduction press test. While promising intra-tester reliability has been found for maximal strength during the long-lever hip adduction squeeze test, inter-tester reliability may be more challenging during both maximal and explosive strength measurements.
HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to assess intra- and inter-tester reliability of maximal, and explosive strength during the long lever hip adduction squeeze test and the long lever hip abduction press test in healthy adults using a hand-held dynamometer.
STUDY DESIGN: Intra- and interrater reliability study.
METHODS: Forty-nine healthy subjects were included for intra- (n=20) and inter-tester reliability (n=29). Subjects performed the hip adduction long lever squeeze test and the bilateral hip abduction press test in a randomized order. Maximal isometric strength and early (0-100 ms) and late (0-200 ms) phase rate of force development (explosive muscle strength) was obtained using a hand-held dynamometer. Relative reliability for all tests was assessed using ICC2,1 two-way mixed model with absolute agreement, thereby taking bias between testers into account.
RESULTS: Maximal isometric strength showed good intra- and inter-tester reliability for adduction (ICC: 0.93-0.97) and abduction (ICC: 0.88-0.92). For 0-200 ms rate of force development, both the squeeze and press test showed good intra-tester reliability (ICC: 0.85-0.87), whereas inter-tester reliability was good for hip adduction squeeze (ICC: 0.75) and moderate for hip abduction press (ICC: 0.71). For 0-100 ms rate of force development, the hip abduction press test showed good intra-tester reliability (ICC: 0.78). Remaining tests for intra- and inter-tester reliability showed moderate reliability (ICC: 0.50-0.71).
CONCLUSION: Assessment of maximal isometric strength in hip adduction squeeze and abduction press test showed good intra- and inter-tester reliability, whereas only 0-200 ms rate of force development demonstrated good intra-tester reliability of both tests. Therefore, rate of force development should preferably be conducted by the same tester, while the long lever squeeze and press test can reliably be used within- and between testers to measure maximal isometric strength.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although hip arthroscopy is a widely adopted treatment option for hip-related pain, it is unknown whether preoperative clinical information can be used to assist surgical decision-making to avoid offering surgery to patients with limited potential for a successful outcome. We aimed to develop and validate clinical prediction models to identify patients more likely to have an unsuccessful or successful outcome 1 year post hip arthroscopy based on the patient acceptable symptom state.
METHODS: Patient records were extracted from the Danish Hip Arthroscopy Registry (DHAR). A priori, 26 common clinical variables from DHAR were selected as prognostic factors, including demographics, radiographic parameters of hip morphology and self-reported measures. We used 1082 hip arthroscopy patients (surgery performed 25 April 2012 to 4 October 2017) to develop the clinical prediction models based on logistic regression analyses. The development models were internally validated using bootstrapping and shrinkage before temporal external validation was performed using 464 hip arthroscopy patients (surgery performed 5 October 2017 to 13 May 2019).
RESULTS: The prediction model for unsuccessful outcomes showed best and acceptable predictive performance on the external validation dataset for all multiple imputations (Nagelkerke R2 range: 0.25-0.26) and calibration (intercept range: -0.10 to -0.11; slope range: 1.06-1.09), and acceptable discrimination (area under the curve range: 0.76-0.77). The prediction model for successful outcomes did not calibrate well, while also showing poor discrimination.
CONCLUSION: Common clinical variables including demographics, radiographic parameters of hip morphology and self-reported measures were able to predict the probability of having an unsuccessful outcome 1 year after hip arthroscopy, while the model for successful outcome showed unacceptable accuracy. The externally validated prediction model can be used to support clinical evaluation and shared decision making by informing the orthopaedic surgeon and patient about the risk of an unsuccessful outcome, and thus when surgery may not be appropriate.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To explore relationships between groin pain and adductor squeeze strength in male academy football players over a 14-week period.
DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study.
METHODS: Weekly monitoring of youth male football players consisted of reporting groin pain and testing long lever adductor squeeze strength. Players who reported groin pain at any time during the study period were stratified into the "groin pain" group while players who did not report pain remained in the "no groin pain" group. Baseline squeeze strength was retrospectively compared between groups. Players that developed groin pain were examined via repeated measures ANOVA at four timepoints: baseline, last squeeze before pain, pain onset, and return to pain-free.
RESULTS: 53 players were included (age 14.4 ± 1.6 years). Baseline squeeze strength was not different between players in the "groin pain" (n = 29, 4.35 ± 0.89 N/kg) versus "no groin pain" group (n = 24, 4.33 ± 0.90 N/kg, p = 0.83). At a group level, players with no groin pain maintained similar adductor squeeze strength throughout 14 weeks (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Compared to baseline (4.33 ± 0.90 N/kg), players with groin pain had decreased adductor squeeze strength at the last squeeze before pain (3.91 ± 0.85 N/kg, p = 0.003) and at pain onset (3.58 ± 0.78 N/kg, p {\textless} 0.001). Adductor squeeze strength at the point where pain subsided (4.06 ± 0.95 N/kg) was not different from baseline (p = 0.14).
CONCLUSIONS: Decreases in adductor squeeze strength manifest one-week prior to groin pain onset and further decrease at pain onset. Weekly adductor squeeze strength may be an early detector for groin pain in youth male football players.},

Thirty-five amateur male players (age: 17-26 years) were randomized to a do-as-usual control group (CG; n = 17) or to 10-weeks of supervised strength training using the NHE in-season (IG; n = 18). A repeated-sprint test, consisting of 4 × 6 10 m sprints, with 15 s recovery period between sprints and 180 s between sets, was conducted to evaluate total sprint time as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were best 10 m sprint time (10mST) and sprint time during the last sprint (L10mST). Additionally, peak eccentric hamstring strength (ECC-PHS) and eccentric hamstring strength capacity (ECC-CAPHS) were measured during the NHE. Ten players were lost to follow-up, thus 25 players were analyzed (CG n = 14; IG n = 11). Between-group differences in mean changes were observed in favor of the IG for sprint performance outcomes; TST (-0.649 s, p = 0.056, d = 0.38), 10mST (-0.047 s, p = 0.005, d = 0.64) and L10mST (-0.052 s, p = 0.094, d = 0.59), and for strength outcomes; ECC-PHS (62.3 N, p = 0.006, d = 0.92), and ECC-CAPHS (951 N, p = 0.005, d = 0.95). In conclusion, the NHE showed small-to-medium improvements in sprint performance and large increases in peak eccentric hamstring strength and capacity.

PURPOSE: To investigate whether demographic and radiographic factors were associated with moderate to severe hip joint cartilage injury.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: Patients were identified in the Danish Hip Arthroscopy Registry. The outcome variables were acetabular cartilage injury (modified Beck grade 0-2 vs 3-4) and femoral head cartilage injury (International Cartilage Repair Society grade 0-2 vs 3-4). Logistic regressions assessed the association with the following: age ({\textless}30 vs 30-50 years); sex; sport activity level (Hip Sports Activity Scale); alpha angle (AA) assessed as normal (AA {\textless}55°), cam (55°≤ AA {\textless}78°), or severe cam (AA ≥78°); lateral center-edge angle (LCEA) assessed as normal (25°≤ LCEA ≤ 39°), pincer (LCEA {\textgreater}39°), or borderline dysplasia (LCEA {\textless}25°); joint space width (JSW) assessed as normal (JSW {\textgreater}4.0 mm), mild reduction (3.1 mm ≤ JSW ≤ 4.0 mm), or severe reduction (2.1 mm ≤ JSW ≤ 3.0 mm).
RESULTS: A total of 1511 patients were included (mean ± SD age: 34.9 ± 9.8 years). Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 4.42), higher age (OR, 1.70), increased AA (cam: OR, 2.23; severe cam: OR, 4.82), and reduced JSW (mild: OR, 2.04; severe: OR, 3.19) were associated (P {\textless} .05) with Beck grade 3-4. Higher age (OR, 1.92), increased Hip Sports Activity Scale (OR, 1.13), borderline dysplasia (OR, 3.08), and reduced JSW (mild: OR, 2.63; severe: OR, 3.04) were associated (P {\textless} .05) with International Cartilage Repair Society grade 3-4.
CONCLUSION: Several demographic and radiographic factors were associated with moderate to severe hip joint cartilage injury. Most notably, increased cam severity and borderline dysplasia substantially increased the risk of grade 3-4 acetabular and femoral head cartilage injury, respectively, indicating that specific deformity may drive specific cartilage injury patterns in the hip joint.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evaluation of hip muscle function is considered an important part of the examination and treatment of physically active subjects with hip and groin pain. However, methods to reliably measure explosive hip muscle strength are lacking.
HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The purpose was to investigate the reliability of a clinically available set-up using a fixated handheld dynamometer to test isometric peak force and rate of force development of the hip abductors, adductors, flexors, and extensors.
METHODS: Seventeen subjects (males: 9, females: 8, mean aged 25.4 (+/- 4.2) y, with mean body mass of 73.9 (+/- 15.2) kg, and mean height 174.2 (+/- 12.4) cm) were included. One experienced tester performed all measures in a randomized order. Three trials of isometric peak force and early- (0-100 ms) and late-phase (0-200 ms) rate of force development for the hip abductors, adductors, flexors, and extensors were obtained using a fixated handheld dynamometer. The trial with the highest value for each measure was used for analysis. Test-retest sessions were separated by 30 minutes of rest.
RESULTS: No systematic between-session bias were observed for any of the measures. The relative intra-tester reliability (ICC2,1) for peak force, 0-100 ms rate of force development, and 0-200 ms rate of force development ranged from 0.93-0.96, 0.82-0.93, and 0.85-0.92, respectively, corresponding to good reliability for all force measures.
CONCLUSION: The present study shows that assessment of isometric hip muscle peak force, including early- (0-100 ms) and late-phase (0-200 ms) rate of force development using a fixated handheld dynamometer have good intra-tester reliability for testing of the hip adductors, abductors, flexors and extensors. Thus, in clinical research settings where an isokinetic dynamometer may not always be readily accessible, the present test procedure can be used as a feasible alternative to reliably provide objective of hip muscle function relevant for rehabilitation of patients with hip and groin pain.

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the association between hamstring muscle peak torque and rapid force capacity (rate of torque development, RTD) vs sprint performance in elite youth football players. Methods: Thirty elite academy youth football players (16.75 [1.1] y, 176.9 [6.7] cm, 67.1 [6.9] kg) were included. Isometric peak torque (in Newton meters per kilogram) and early- (0-100 ms) and late- (0-200 ms) phase RTD (RTD100, RTD200) (in Newton meters per second per kilogram) of the hamstring muscles were obtained as independent predictor variables. Sprint performance was assessed during a 30-m-sprint trial. Mechanical sprint variables (maximal horizontal force production [FH0, in Newtons per kilogram], maximal theoretical velocity [V0, in meters per second], maximal horizontal power output [Pmax, in watts per kilogram]) and sprint split times (0-5, 0-15, 0-30, and 15-30 m, in seconds) were derived as dependent variables. Subsequently, linear-regression analysis was conducted for each pair of dependent and independent variables. Results: Positive associations were observed between hamstring RTD100 and FH0 (r2 = .241, P = .006) and Pmax (r2 = .227, P = .008). Furthermore, negative associations were observed between hamstring RTD100 and 0- to 5-m (r2 = .206, P = .012), 0- to 15-m (r2 = .217, P = .009), and 0- to 30-m sprint time (r2 = .169, P = .024). No other associations were observed. Conclusions: The present data indicate that early-phase (0-100 ms) rapid force capacity of the hamstring muscles plays an important role for acceleration capacity in elite youth football players. In contrast, no associations were observed between hamstring muscle function and maximal sprint velocity. This indicates that strength training focusing on improving early-phase hamstring rate of force development may contribute to enhance sprint acceleration performance in this athlete population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A recent systematic review found that 87\% of athletes return to sport after hip surgery for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. However, the proportion of athletes returning to preinjury sport at their preinjury level of sport is less clear.
PURPOSE: The main purpose of this study was to determine the rate of athletes returning to preinjury sport at preinjury level including their associated sports performance after hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. Furthermore, self-reported hip and groin function was investigated.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: Eligible subjects were identified in the Danish Hip Arthroscopy Registry. A self-reported return to sport questionnaire was used to collect data after hip arthroscopy. If athletes reported they were engaged in preinjury sport at their preinjury level, the associated sports performance and participation were assessed as either (1) optimal sports performance including full sports participation; (2) impaired sports performance, but full sports participation; or (3) impaired sports performance including restricted sports participation. Self-reported hip and groin function was assessed for all athletes by use of the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score.
RESULTS: The study included 189 athletes (mean ± SD age at follow-up, 26.9 ± 3.4 years) at a mean ± SD follow-up of 33.1 ± 16.3 months after surgery. At follow-up, 108 athletes (57.1\%) were playing preinjury sport at preinjury level, whereas the remaining 81 athletes (42.9\%) failed to return to preinjury sport at preinjury level. Of the 108 athletes engaged in their preinjury sport at preinjury level at follow-up, 32 athletes (29.6\%) reported optimal sports performance including full sports participation, corresponding to 16.9\% of the study sample. Better self-reported hip and groin function was observed in athletes who were engaged in preinjury sport at preinjury level compared with athletes who were not.
CONCLUSION: Fifty-seven percent of athletes returned to preinjury sport at their preinjury level. This is considerably lower than a previously reported return to sport rate of 87\% and may reflect that the present study used a clear and strict definition of return to sport. Of note, only one-third of athletes who returned to preinjury sport at preinjury level reported their sports performance to be optimal, corresponding to 16.9\% of the study sample. Better self-reported hip and groin function was observed in athletes who were playing preinjury sport at preinjury level compared with athletes who were not.},

	abstract = {Footballers with weak hip adductors are at increased risk of groin injury, and adductor strengthening has been shown to reduce this risk. However, the minimal effective dose of strength training to improve hip adductor strength and mitigate the risk of adductor problems remains unknown. The aim of this randomised controlled trial was to investigate the training and detraining effects of a low-dose Copenhagen adduction exercise (CA) intervention in sub-elite male footballers on eccentric hip adduction strength (primary outcome) and peak adductor squeeze strength (secondary outcome). Thirty-nine male footballers were randomised into two groups: The intervention group completed the CA twice weekly during six in-season weeks in addition to normal football training, while the control group continued normal football training. Strength testing was performed at weeks 0, 3, 6 (training period), and weeks 7-9 (detraining period). There was no between-group difference in eccentric strength at week 6 and 9. There was a significant group by time interaction at 6 weeks (0.52 Nm/kg, 95\% CI 0.17-0.86) and 9 weeks (0.59 Nm/kg, 95\% CI 0.25-0.93) at which the intervention group displayed greater adductor squeeze strength. These results suggest the low-dose CA intervention is insufficient to modify eccentric hip adduction strength but improves peak adductor squeeze strength.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effects of specific bony hip morphologies, cam and dysplasia, and cartilage damage on mid- and long-term (≥5 years) patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are understudied.
PURPOSE: To investigate if changes in PROs from preoperatively to 5 years after hip arthroscopy are associated with preoperative bony hip morphology and cartilage status in patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: Patients were identified in the Danish Hip Arthroscopy Registry. Hip and groin function was assessed from preoperatively to 5 years postoperatively with the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Sports and Recreation (Sport) subscales. Morphology was defined using the anterior alpha angle (AA) and lateral center-edge angle (LCEA) as follows: mild to moderate cam (55°≤ AA {\textless} 78°), severe cam (AA ≥ 78°), pincer (LCEA {\textgreater} 39°), and borderline dysplasia (20°≤ LCEA {\textless} 25°). Joint space width (JSW) was defined as slightly reduced (3.1 mm ≤ JSW ≤ 4 mm) or severely reduced (2.1 mm ≤ JSW ≤ 3 mm). Acetabular cartilage status was defined by modified Beck grades 0 to 4 and femoral head cartilage status by International Cartilage Regeneration \& Joint Preservation Society grades 0 to 4. Acetabular and femoral cartilage injury areas were categorized as {\textless}1, 1 to 2, or {\textgreater}2 cm2. Multiple regression analyses assessed adjusted associations between hip morphology and cartilage injuries with improvement in HAGOS-ADL and HAGOS-Sport.
RESULTS: The study included 281 patients (age, 35 ± 10 years; 52.3\% female). No cam and mild-to-moderate cam were associated with greater improvement in HAGOS-ADL (16 points [P = .002] and 7 points [P = .038], respectively) compared with severe cam. Normal JSW was associated with greater improvement in HAGOS-ADL (21 points; P = .026) compared with severely reduced JSW. Femoral head cartilage injury area {\textless}1 cm2 was associated with greater improvements in HAGOS-ADL (17 points; P = .03) and HAGOS-Sport (21 points; P = .035) compared with femoral cartilage injury area {\textgreater}2 cm2.
CONCLUSION: Patients having no-to-moderate cam morphology, normal JSW, or femoral head cartilage injury area {\textless}1 cm2 had greater improvement in PROs 5 years after hip arthroscopy compared with patients having severe cam morphology, severely reduced JSW, or femoral cartilage injury area {\textgreater}2 cm2.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study implemented the Copenhagen Adductor Exercise (CAE) and Nordic Hamstring Exercise (NHE) to examine 1) whether CAE and NHE interventions are associated with adductor and hamstring strength gains in youth African male soccer players and 2) whether strength changes after a rest period and secondary intervention.
STUDY DESIGN: Pre-post intervention study.
METHODS: Forty-four African elite male academy players (age 14.7±1.5 [12-18] years) participated in twice weekly CAE and NHE interventions for 8- and 10-week periods separated by a 4-week rest. Long lever adductor squeeze strength and prone isometric hamstring strength were measured with mixed-effects linear regression models to observe strength changes over time.
RESULTS: Ninety-six and 95\% of CAE and NHE sessions were completed in each intervention, with no adverse events related to the execution of the exercises. Adductor squeeze strength increased during the first intervention (baseline 3.23 [2.99-3.47] N/kg, post-intervention 3.53 [3.30-3.76] N/kg, p=0.911) and was maintained following the rest period (3.52 [3.27-3.76] N/kg, p=0.999) and second intervention (3.60 [3.35-3.84] N/kg, p=0.002). Hamstring strength improved during the first intervention (baseline 4.95 [4.42-5.49] N/kg, post-intervention 5.48 [4.95-6.02] N/kg, p{\textless}0.001), decreased to baseline during the rest period (4.98 [4.44-5.53] N/kg, p=0.996), and did not improve during the second intervention (5.01 [4.46-5.55] N/kg, p=0.978).
CONCLUSION: CAE and NHE interventions can be implemented at an elite African academy with high compliance. Adductor and hamstring strength improved in the first intervention, with no further improvements in the second intervention. Secondary interventions therefore should include higher exercise volume or load to improve longitudinal adductor and hamstring strength.
