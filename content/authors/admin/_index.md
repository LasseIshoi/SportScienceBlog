I am an aspiring researcher, physiotherapist, and sports scientist with a great interest in hip/groin and hamstring injuries. I am part of the Sports Orthopedic Research Center - Copenhagen (SORC-C) at Hvidovre Hospital; an International Olympic Committee (IOC) research center centered around prevention, diagnostics and treatment of musculoskeletal problems.

I am a PhD student in SORC-C focusing on non-operative treatment of young patients with activity-related longstanding hip and groin pain as well as evaluating outcomes following hip arthroscopy.

I serve as the Sports Science Coordinator in Football Club Nordsjælland (FCN), a Danish premier league football club with associated youth academies in Denmark and Ghana (rated as one of the world’s best academies according to Scouted Football (https://www.scoutedftbl.com/best-young-football-players/academies/), where I focus on structured data collection and associated analyses to support physical trainers and physiotherapists.
