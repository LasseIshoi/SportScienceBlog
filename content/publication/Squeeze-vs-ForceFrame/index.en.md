abstract: "**Objectives**
  
  To compare long-lever squeeze testing using the ForceFrame and the Copenhagen 5-Second Squeeze test (5SST) for assessment of hip    adduction strength and provoked groin pain in elite male soccer players.

  **Design**
  
  Cross-sectional study.

  **Setting**
  Pre-season testing at facilities of a Danish professional 1st tier soccer club and academy.

  **Participants**
  Elite male soccer players (n ¼ 83, mean age; 16 ± 2.7 years) from U13, U14, U15, U17, U19 and senior teams cleared for full         training and match participation.

  **Main outcome measures**
  Maximum isometric hip adduction strength (Nm/kg) and provoked groin pain (NRS 0-10).

  **Results**
  Hip adduction strength was 16% lower in the ForceFrame. A Bland-Altman plot showed a systematic bias (-0.47 Nm/kg, 95%              CI[-0.57; -0.38]) and lack of agreement (95% limits of agreement: -1.31;0.39 Nm/kg). In the ForceFrame, provoked groin pain was     less intense (median NRS 0 [IQR: 0e1] vs. 5SST:1 [IQR: 0e3], p < 0.001) and reported by fewer players (NRS >0) (27% [n ¼ 22] vs.    5SST: 61.4% [n ¼ 51],p < 0.001).

  **Conclusions**
  The ForceFrame and the 5SST lack agreement and are not interchangeable methods. This may have implications when selecting a         method for screening and detecting early groin problems in male soccer players."
