Welcome to my personal site. I am a physiotherapist, Sport Scientist, and PhD candidate.  


This page serves the purpose of an online resume, blog, and sharing my own R packages that may be useful for the sport scientist. You will also find my list of publications which concentrate on hip/groin-related pain (PhD topic) and sports performance.  

I am part of the Sports Orthopedic Research Center - Copenhagen (SORC - C) where my main research topic is femoroacetabular impingement and hip arthroscopy, in which area I have published several papers aiming at understanding the outcomes after hip arthroscopy.
