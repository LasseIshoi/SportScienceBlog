Working as a sport scientist requires handling of data from many different external sources. One of these may be from the __[Second Spectrum](https://www.secondspectrum.com/index.html)__, a match video tracking and analytics provider for many major leagues, including the Danish Superliga.  

While Second Spectrum provides a basic overview of physical match data across teams and players in the league, more comprehensive analyses and visualizations require export of the data. Unfortunately, this does not come in a tidy format suitable for analyses i R, why a saw the need to develop a small R package to transform the exported csv files into a tidy format.  

I this blog post I provide a walkthrough of the data cleaning and manipulation process of the __[TidySpectrum package](https://lasseishoi.github.io/TidySpectrum/)__.  ![screen reader text](TidySpectrum.png)


In relation to this, a big shout out to the __[TidyX Screencast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP8l94xtoemCH_GxByvTuFQ)__ by Patrick Ward and Ellis Hughes, who have recorded two excellent videos on how to __[clean ugly excel files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8LK1SNH9p0&list=PLdb0LTjA9iQyWeiYBhUHYFve349gTFF9s&index=4)__.  

I am certain that the data cleaning and manipulation process/code can be done way more elegantly than what I ended up with, but it does the job which for me is the most important success criteria.  

Second Spectrum give access to different physical data files, of which I am most interested in the Physical Splits summery, which essentially provides 5 minutes spilts of different running metrics for all players at both teams, including for each team.  

Let us first have a look at the top 50 rows of the csv file as it appear if you import it into R using the `read_csv` function. In the first few rows you have some meta-data with information on the date and which two teams played each other, followed by some velocity threshold definitions. A few rows later there is an embedded header representing the minute splits followed by TeamA (including metrics) and all players for that particular team (including metrics for each player). It is obvious that this is not a data structure/format suited for analyses. 

```{r SecondSpectrum csv, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(readr)
library(kableExtra)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

data_sample <- read_csv("C:/Users/lasse/OneDrive/Skrivebord/SecondSpectrumSample.csv")

data_sample_head <- head(data_sample, 50)

```

```{r table SecondSpectrum, echo=FALSE}
kableExtra::kable(data_sample_head) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic_2()

```

For transforming this csv file into a tidy format, I first extracted the important meta-data (teams and date) as values and subsequnetly deleted the top 12 rows.

```{r meta-data cleaning}

#extract the value in the first column and row in a new data frame
 Match_data <- data_sample[1,1]

#Since the Match_data now contains both Team and date in a single column, I separate the column into two columns 
  Match_data <- Match_data %>%
    separate(col = "Second Spectrum Split Data", into = c("match", "date"), sep = " : ")

#and subsequently store each value
  match <- Match_data$match
  date <- Match_data$date

#then delete the inital 12 rows of the data frame
  data_skip <- data_sample %>%
    slice(13:max(nrow(data_sample)))
  
```

The new data frame now looks like this (top 10 rows): 

```{r skip data table, echo=FALSE}

head_data_skip <- head(data_skip, 10)

kable(head_data_skip) %>%
    kable_classic_2()
```

As the rows "Minute Splits" mark the points for each team, I identified the row numbers where this occured and then splitted the data frame in two, one for each team. 

```{r split data frame}

#Using the which function to identify row numbers for Minute Spilts, which mark the separation of the two teams
  splits <- which(data_skip$`Second Spectrum Split Data` == "Minute Splits")

#Using the row numbers to slice the data frame and two splits, one for each team
  data_split_1 <- data_skip %>%
    slice(splits[1]:(splits[2]-1))

  data_split_2 <- data_skip %>%
    slice(splits[2]:max(nrow(data_skip)))

#Combine in a list
  list_split_team <- list(data_split_1, data_split_2)

```

Now that data from the two teams are in seperate date frames contained in a list, I can use the `map` function from the `purrr`package to apply functions across all list elements. This makes the coding less repetitive. 

```{r initial list manipulation, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
  
#I first move the first row up to become column names, remove empty rows/columns, and clean column names since (this is important this there are two splits with 50) using the janitor package. change first row to col names, remove emply rows and/or columns, and create unique colnames, rename, and add row numbers for breaks
  list_split_team <- list_split_team %>%
    map(function(x){row_to_names(x, 1)}) %>%
    map(function(x){remove_empty(x)}) %>%
    map(function(x){clean_names(x)}) %>%
#I then rename the first column from minute split, which was the name of the row, to metric, which then contains the different running measures
    map(function(x){rename(x, metric = minute_splits)}) %>%
#I create a new column with row number, which I need to cut a data frame in chunks containing a player each 
    map(function(x){mutate(x, row_number = row_number())}) %>%
#I create a new column with the value from the first column and row (that the the team name)
    map(function(x) {mutate(x, "team_sep" = x[[1,1]])}) %>%
#For each team/player the running based metrics are contained in 12 rows, so I use the cut function to mark cuts every 12th rows
    map(function(x){mutate(x, cuts = cut(x$row_number, breaks = (max(nrow(x))/12)))}) %>%
#I also mark the initial 12 rows versus the remaining rows and label those "group" and "individual" to mark whether the metrics a based on a team or individual level
    map(function(x){mutate(x, level = cut(x$row_number, breaks = c(0,12, max(nrow(x))), labels = c("group", "individual")))})

#I then create a data from each team
  data_split_1 <- list_split_team[[1]]
  data_split_2 <- list_split_team[[2]]


#split each data frame based on the cuts for each player, so I end up with two lists - one for each team each containing separate data frames for each player
  list_team_1 <- data_split_1 %>%
    group_split(cuts)
  list_team_2 <- data_split_2 %>%
    group_split(cuts)

#and finally combine those two lists into a single list 
  list_team_combined <- append(list_team_1, list_team_2)
  
```

Each data frame for an individual player now looks like this:

```{r data frame individual player, echo=FALSE}

kableExtra::kable(list_team_1[[2]]) %>%
  kable_classic_2()
```

The next step is to separate the athlete name from the metric column and then clean all the NA values of the first row.

```{r individual data cleaning}

#mutate a new variable "id" based on first row/column (identifier name) in each data frame 
  list_team_combined <- list_team_combined  %>%
    map(function(x) {mutate(x, "id" = x[[1,1]])}) %>%
#and omit all na to clean data frames
    map(function(x){na.omit(x)})
```

Now that the name has been mutated to a new column, we are slowly approaching a tidy data format, that now looks like this:

```{r individual after data cleaning, echo=FALSE}

kableExtra::kable(list_team_combined[[2]]) %>%
  kable_classic_2()

```

I now bind lists back into a single data frame, and clean up the table so that column names etc. makes sense.

```{r}

#bind lists into dateframe
  df_data_combined <- list_team_combined %>%
    bind_rows()

#separate team/player name from identifier (the numbers/characters contained in brackets after each player/team name)
  df_data_combined  <- df_data_combined  %>%
    separate(col = id, into = c("id", NA), sep = "[(]") %>%
    separate(col = team_sep, into = c("team", NA), sep = "[(]")
  
#delete unnecessary columns, columns that are no longer needed (row_number and cuts)
  df_data_combined <- df_data_combined %>%
    select(-c("row_number", "cuts"))
  
```

We now need to tidy up the column names (splits) and label first and second half.

```{r colnames splits}

#First select the the first half data set. This can be achieved by selecting the columns from the "metric" to the "x50_2" subsequently deleting the "x50_2" column as this belongs to the second half. We need to do it this way, since the last column of the first half also contains "x50".
  df_data_combined_first <- df_data_combined %>%
    select(metric:ends_with("2")) %>%
    select(-(ends_with("2")))

#select second half data (from "x50_2" to "id" columns)
  df_data_combined_second <- df_data_combined %>%
    select(ends_with("2"):id)

#In each of the two data frames we now change "x" to "first_" or "second_", respectively, to label the period in the game. This is not necessary, but give some nice oppurtunity to finter on half once we turn the data into a tidy format
  names(df_data_combined_first) <- gsub("x", "first_", names(df_data_combined_first))

#change x to second
  names(df_data_combined_second) <- gsub("_2", "", names(df_data_combined_second))
  names(df_data_combined_second) <- gsub("x", "second_", names(df_data_combined_second))

#bind columns from the two data frames back to single dataframe
  df_data_combined <- bind_cols(df_data_combined_first, df_data_combined_second)

```

The data frame now looks like this:

```{r data frame split names cleaned, echo = FALSE}

df_data_combined_head <- head(df_data_combined, 10)

kableExtra::kable(df_data_combined_head) %>%
  kable_classic_2()

```

The final step is now to turn the data frame into a long format and clean the last part, eg. first_5

```{r final step}

#use the pivot longer to change from wide to long format based on all numeric columns (all columns containing split values)
  df_data_long <- df_data_combined %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = where(is.numeric), names_to = "split", values_to = "value")

#separate the row names with split labels (eg. first_5) into two columns with "half" (first and second, respectively) and "splits" (eg. 5, 10, 10 etc.)
  df_data_long <- df_data_long %>%
    separate(col = split, into = c("half", "splits"), sep = "_") %>%
    mutate(match = match,
           date = date)
  
#change the data column from character string to date format
  df_data_long$date <- as.Date(df_data_long$date)

```  
  
The final tidy data frame now look like this ready to be analysed in R (initial 20 rows showed): 

```{r data frame final, echo = FALSE}

df_data_long_head <- head(df_data_long, 20)

kableExtra::kable(df_data_long_head) %>%
  kable_classic_2()

```

Last part was to wrap it all into a function and finally package. The above outline takes only one csv file, but in the package there is a function that also analyses a list of csv data frames, which makes it easy to perform multiple match analyses fast and easy. 

I welcome any feedback/suggestions for improvements of the code, but for now it gets the job done.
