&lt;div id=&#34;abstract&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Reduced sports function is often observed after hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS). Impaired muscle strength could be reasons for this. We aimed to investigate hip muscle strength after hip arthroscopy for FAIS and its association with sports function and participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Cross-sectional study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We included 45 patients (34 males; mean age: 30.6 ± 5.9years) after unilateral hip arthroscopy for FAIS (mean follow-up [range]: 19.3 [9.8–28.4] months). Maximal isometric hip muscle strength (Nm/kg) including early- (0–100 ms) and late-phase (0–200 ms) rate of torque development (Nm∗kg−1∗s−1) for adduction, abduction, flexion, and extension was measured with an externally fixated handheld dynamometer and compared between operated and non-operated hip. Associations between muscle strength and self-reported sports function and return to sport were investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For maximal hip muscle strength, no between-hip differences were observed for adduction, abduction, flexion, and extension (p ≥ 0.102). For rate of torque development, significantly lower values were observed for the operated hip in flexion at both 0–100 ms (mean difference: 1.58 Nm∗kg−1∗s−1, 95% CI [0.39; 2.77], p=0.01) and 0–200 ms (mean difference: 0.72 Nm∗kg−1∗s−1, 95% CI [0.09; 1.35], p=0.027). Higher maximal hip extension strength was significantly associated with greater ability to participate fully in preinjury sport at preinjury level (odds ratio: 17.71 95% CI [1.77; 177.60]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After hip arthroscopy for FAIS subjects show limited impairments in maximal and explosive hip muscle strength between operated and non-operated hip. Higher muscle strength was positively associated with higher sports function and ability to participate in sport.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Many Patients Achieve an Acceptable Symptom State After Hip Arthroscopy for Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome? A Cross-sectional Study Including PASS Cutoff Values for the HAGOS and iHOT-33</title>

&lt;div id=&#34;abstract&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hip arthroscopy is a viable treatment for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS). Clinically relevant improvements in hip function and pain after surgery are often reported, but it is less clear how many patients achieve an acceptable symptom state (Patient Acceptable Symptom State [PASS]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To investigate the proportion of patients who achieved a PASS 12 to 24 months after hip arthroscopy and to determine the cutoff scores of the 2 recommended and valid patient-reported outcome measures (the subscales of the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score [HAGOS] and the International Hip Outcome Tool—33 [iHOT-33]) for which patients are most likely to achieve PASS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Eligible study patients were identified in the Danish Hip Arthroscopy Registry. An electronic questionnaire was used to collect data on PASS, HAGOS, and iHOT-33 12 to 24 months after surgery. PASS was measured using an anchor question. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were applied to identify the PASS cutoff values of HAGOS and iHOT-33 scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A total of 137 individuals (mean age at surgery, 35.4 ± 9.4 years) were included in the study at a mean follow-up of 18.5 ± 3.2 months after surgery. At follow-up, 64 individuals (46.7%; 95% CI, 38.6-55.1) reported PASS. Higher HAGOS and iHOT-33 values were observed for participants who reported PASS compared with those who did not report PASS (Cohen d ≥ 1.06; P &amp;lt; .001). Cutoff scores for HAGOS subscales (42.5-82.5) and iHOT-33 (67.00) showed excellent to outstanding discriminative ability in predicting PASS (area under the curve, 0.82-0.92).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In total, 46% of individuals having hip arthroscopy for FAIS achieved PASS at 12 to 24 months of follow-up. Patients who achieved PASS had statistically significant and substantially better self-reported hip function compared with those who did not achieve PASS. Cutoff values at HAGOS subscales and iHOT-33 showed excellent to outstanding discriminative ability in predicting patients with PASS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
