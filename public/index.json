Briefly described, the AS profile is in-game recording of the maximal acceleration and speed capabilities based on instantaneous acceleration and speed data from GPS or equivalent tracking devices from multiple training sessions/games. For an in depth overview of the concept, a good place to start is the blogpost or Presentation by JB Morin and/or the following scientific papers:\n\rIndividual acceleration-speed profile in-situ: A proof of concept in professional football players\rReliability of individual acceleration-speed profile in-situ in elite youth soccer players\rMinimal Number of Events Required for Acceleration-Speed Profiling in Elite Women‚Äôs Soccer\r\r\rThe simple but tedious way of calculating the AS Profile\rOnly a few GPS providers allow for the calculation of the AS profile in the cloud using proprietary software, so being able to calculate the AS profile yourself may be valuable. Luckily, this can be simply done by using the web application by Yann Le Mat - all it takes is to upload the raw GPS data as a .csv file.\nAlthough this seems easy enough, several training sessions are needed for a valid and reliable estimation of the AS profile (see linked papers above), thus calculating the AS profile for a whole squad can easily mean that 100-200 .csv files need to be downloaded (typically 1 file per player per session with 30.000-100.000 rows depending on the session duration). This quickly becomes very tedious work!\n\rThe easier way using the CatapultR Package and R Studio\rAnother, and much easier, method (at least if working with Catapult GPS data) is to leverage the power of R and the catapultR package which serves as a wrapper for the Catapult API. This essentially means that no manual downloading of .csv files are needed. Below, I will show you step by step how you can use the CatapultR package to download the raw GPS 10Hz data.\nTo get started in R Studio, I load the following packages:\nlibrary(catapultR)\rlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(lubridate)\r‚Ä¶and set a few placeholder variables and the API connection:\n#Set player name, and date range for the data of interest\rplayerName \u0026lt;- name\rstartDate \u0026lt;- startdate\rendDate \u0026lt;- enddate\r#Get API Access\rsToken \u0026lt;- stoken\rsRegion \u0026lt;- sregion\r#Setup API connection\rtoken \u0026lt;- ofCloudCreateToken(sToken = sToken, sRegion = sRegion)\rThe next code chunks uses several functions from the CatapultR package to retrieve the raw 10HZ sensor data via the API connection. I use the three parameters (defined above) playerName, startDate, and endDate to specify the data of interest.\nI first extract a list of athletes, format the start and end dates, and extract a list of activities in the specified period:\n# Get a list of athletes connected to the Token user\rathletes \u0026lt;- ofCloudGetAthletes(token)\r# Use the playerName to identify the associated athlete id\rathletes$player_name \u0026lt;- paste(athletes$first_name, athletes$last_name)\rathleteID \u0026lt;- athletes$id[athletes$player_name==playerName]\r# Get a list activities from the specified period\rfrom \u0026lt;- as.integer(as.POSIXct(as.Date(startDate, format=\u0026#34;%d-%m-%Y\u0026#34;)))\rto \u0026lt;- as.integer(as.POSIXct(as.Date(endDate, format=\u0026#34;%d-%m-%Y\u0026#34;)))\ractivities \u0026lt;- ofCloudGetActivities(token, from = from, to = to)\rI then create a for loop to loop over the list of activities, and extract activities where the player of interest is present:\n# Loop over the activities for the specific athlete to get the 10Hz raw data\r# Create output variable as a list using the vector function with length equal to number of activities\rrawData \u0026lt;- vector(\u0026#34;list\u0026#34;, nrow(activities))\r# For loop using the ofCloudGetActivitySensorData function which takes the athleteID and an activity as arguments. #\u0026#34;Try\u0026#34; function suppresses an error in the for loop if the athlete is not part of an activity.\rfor (i in seq_along(activities)) {try(\rrawData[[i]] \u0026lt;- ofCloudGetActivitySensorData(\rtoken,\rathlete_id = athleteID,\ractivity_id = activities$id[[i]],\rparameters = c(\u0026#34;ts\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cs\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;xy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;o\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;v\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;rv\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;hr\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pq\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ref\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;hdop\u0026#34;)), silent = TRUE)\r}\rNow that I have the raw 10Hz sensor data for each activity extracted and in a list, I use the ‚Äúmap‚Äù (that applies a function on a list) and ‚Äúunnest‚Äù functions to unnest the gps variables for each activity:\n# Map function to unnest the data (gps variables) column across the list. # \u0026#34;Possibly\u0026#34; function secures that the unnest function does not stop due to error\rrawData_list \u0026lt;- rawData %\u0026gt;%\rmap(possibly(~unnest(data = ., cols = \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;), NULL)) %\u0026gt;%\r# Delete empty lists - these are activities where the player of interest has not participated\rcompact()\rAnd finally, I rename the columns and create a few additional time columns (timestamp, seconds, elapsed_time):\n# Mutate a time column using lubridate based on ts (epoch), and rename ‚Ä¶","date":1730851200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1730851200,"objectID":"68ee6955d0ee178fa763ee3ba80ebe66","permalink":"https://lasseishoi.netlify.app/post/force-velocity/","publishdate":"2024-11-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/force-velocity/","section":"post","summary":"A simple how-to guide using R Studio","tags":[],"title":"In Situ Acceleration-Speed Profile","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1705950114,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705950114,"objectID":"10be9c81b9315bdc8704629d17642664","permalink":"https://lasseishoi.netlify.app/project/","publishdate":"2024-01-22T20:01:54+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/","section":"","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Project","type":"page"},{"authors":["Camilla Richter","Lasse Ishoi","Otto Kraemer","Per Holmich","Kristian Thorborg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"00f2fbe37fb45118c54b36efeda09125","permalink":"https://lasseishoi.netlify.app/publication/2024-01-01_association_of_5-yea/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024-01-01_association_of_5-yea/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Association of 5-Year Hip Arthroscopy Outcomes with Hip Morphology and Cartilage Status at Time of Surgery: A National Registry Study With HAGOS Outcomes in 281 Patients With Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew D.

One of these may be from the Second Spectrum, a match video tracking and analytics provider for many major leagues, including the Danish Superliga.\nWhile Second Spectrum provides a basic overview of physical match data across teams and players in the league via their cloud solution, more comprehensive analyses and visualizations require export of the data. Unfortunately, this does not come in a tidy format suitable for analyses, why I saw the need to develop a small R package for transforming the exported csv files into a tidy format to make my life easier.\nIn this blog post I provide a walk through of the data cleaning and manipulation process of the TidySpectrum package.\nA big shout out to the TidyX Screencast by Patrick Ward and Ellis Hughes, who have recorded two excellent videos on how to clean ugly excel files.\nSecond Spectrum gives access to different physical data files, of which I am most interested in the Physical Splits, which essentially provides 5 minute splits of different running metrics for all players at both teams, including aggregated for each team.\nLet us first have a look at the top 50 rows of the csv file as it appear if you import it into R using the read_csv function. In the first few rows you have some meta-data with information on the date and which two teams played each other, followed by some velocity threshold definitions. A few rows later there is an embedded header representing the minute splits followed by TeamA (including metrics) and all players for that particular team (including metrics for each player), and so fourth for TeamB.

Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome is a cause of hip-related pain typically diagnosed in young to middle-aged physically active individuals. It is caused by altered hip joint morphology (i.e., the shape of the bones), which, in the middle-aged to elderly, has been linked to the development of osteoarthritis. Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome is often treated surgically using an arthroscopic procedure. While hip arthroscopy effectively alleviates pain and improves function, less is known about how patients consider their function after surgery and whether factors before surgery can help predict the outcome. In this thesis, you will find five papers with the overarching aim of investigating 1) the influence of hip joint morphology as a precursor for early osteoarthritis, 2) subjective and objective outcomes after hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, and 3) if factors before surgery can help predict how patients end up after surgery.\n\n**Methods**\n\nWe first investigated the associations between different characteristics of hip joint morphology with surgically defined hip cartilage injuries using data from the Danish Hip Arthroscopy Registry (Paper I). Second, we surveyed patients who had undergone hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome with regards to their current symptoms and sports function by asking whether they considered their symptoms as acceptable (141 patients, Paper II) and whether they were able to engage in their pre-injury sport (189 patients, Paper III). Subsequently, we measured objective function ‚Äì hip muscle strength and jump performance ‚Äì in 45 patients who had undergone hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (Paper IV). Finally, we developed and externally temporal validated clinical prediction models to predict a successful or unsuccessful outcome after hip arthroscopy using data from the Danish Hip Arthroscopy Registry (1546 patients, Paper V).\n\n**Results**\n\nSpecific hip joint morphologies were associated with distinct cartilage injury patterns. More severe morphology was associated with a higher risk (4-fold) of severe cartilage injuries. A little more than half of the patients rated their symptoms as unacceptable 1-2 years after hip arthroscopy, while 57 % were engaged in their previous sport activities, yet only 17 % had a performance level comparable to before the onset of hip and groin pain. No differences were found in maximal hip muscle strength or jump performance between the operated and non-operated hip 6-30 months after hip arthroscopy. However, the operated hip displayed less explosiveness for hip flexion. Furthermore, having higher hip extension strength was associated with being engaged in pre-injury sport. By using 26 clinical variables collected prior to hip arthroscopy, it was possible to accurately predict the risk of ending up with an unsuccessful outcome (having unacceptable symptoms) 1 year after hip arthroscopy.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nIn this thesis, we have provided an overview of the role of different bony hip joint morphologies for the risk of cartilage injuries, presented a detailed picture of what patients can expect after hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, and developed and validated a clinical prediction model that can be used in clinical practice to guide if hip arthroscopy is beneficial for the patient. We show that the severity of cam morphology increases the risk of cartilage injuries, suggesting that cartilage injuries may be the underlying pathology in these patients. After hip arthroscopy, patients can expect to get better, but up to half of all patients continue to rate their symptoms as unacceptable, and only a few can resume sporting activities without hip and groin problems. By using a clinical prediction model based on typical clinical variables collected prior to surgery, the orthopedic surgeon can estimate the likelihood of the patient ending up with unacceptable symptoms one-year after surgery. This information can be used to guide the decision of whether hip arthroscopy is beneficial for the individual patient and, thus, can help improve hip arthroscopy outcomes in the future.","tags":null,"title":"Explore and download PhD Thesis","type":"event"},{"authors":["Mathias F.
