The authors investigated the age-related variation in maximal hamstring and quadriceps strength in male elite soccer players from under-13 (U-13) to the senior level.\nMethods\nA total of 125 elite soccer players were included from a Danish professional soccer club and associated youth academy (first tier; U-13, n=19; U-14, n=16; U-15, n=19; U-17, n=24; U-19, n=17; and senior, n=30). Maximal voluntary isometric force was assessed for the hamstrings at 15¬∞ knee joint angle and for the quadriceps at 60¬∞ knee joint angle (0¬∞=full extension) using an external-fixated handheld dynamometer. Hamstring-to-quadriceps strength (H:Q) ratio and hamstring and quadriceps maximal voluntary isometric force levels were compared across age groups (U-13 to senior).\nResults\nSenior players showed 18% to 26% lower H:Q ratio compared with all younger age groups (P‚â§0.026). Specific H:Q ratios (mean [95% confidence interval]) were as follows: senior, 0.45 (0.42‚Äì0.48); U-19, 0.61 (0.55‚Äì0.66); U-17, 0.56 (0.51‚Äì0.60); U-15, 0.59 (0.54‚Äì0.64); U-14, 0.54 (0.50‚Äì0.59); and U-13, 0.57 (0.51‚Äì0.62).

An electronic questionnaire was used to collect data on PASS, HAGOS, and iHOT-33 12 to 24 months after surgery. PASS was measured using an anchor question. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were applied to identify the PASS cutoff values of HAGOS and iHOT-33 scores.\nResults\nA total of 137 individuals (mean age at surgery, 35.4 ¬± 9.4 years) were included in the study at a mean follow-up of 18.5 ¬± 3.2 months after surgery.

However, the minimal effective dose of strength training to improve hip adductor strength and mitigate the risk of adductor problems remains unknown. The aim of this randomised controlled trial was to investigate the training and detraining effects of a low-dose Copenhagen adduction exercise (CA) intervention in sub-elite male footballers on eccentric hip adduction strength (primary outcome) and peak adductor squeeze strength (secondary outcome). Thirty-nine male footballers were randomised into two groups: The intervention group completed the CA twice weekly during six in-season weeks in addition to normal football training, while the control group continued normal football training. Strength testing was performed at weeks 0, 3, 6 (training period), and weeks 7-9 (detraining period). There was no between-group difference in eccentric strength at week 6 and 9. There was a significant group by time interaction at 6 weeks (0.52 Nm/kg, 95% CI 0.17-0.86) and 9 weeks (0.59 Nm/kg, 95% CI 0.25-0.93) at which the intervention group displayed greater adductor squeeze strength. These results suggest the low-dose CA intervention is insufficient to modify eccentric hip adduction strength but improves peak adductor squeeze strength.\n\r","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"c03086722da209d94dfb332cf7297aa9","permalink":"https://lasseishoi.netlify.app/publication/2022-02-18-low-dose-copenhagen-adduction/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-02-18-low-dose-copenhagen-adduction/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract\rFootballers with weak hip adductors are at increased risk of groin injury, and adductor strengthening has been shown to reduce this risk.

Following a hamstring injury, deficits in peak and explosive strength may persist after return to sport potentially affecting sprint performance. Assessment of repeated-sprint ability is recognized as an important part of the return to sport evaluation after a hamstring injury.Purpose: This purpose of this exploratory cross-sectional study was to compare sprinting performance obtained during a repeated-sprint test between football players with and without a previous hamstring strain injury.\nMethods\nForty-four fully active sub-elite football players, 11 with a previous hamstring strain injury during the preceding 12 months (cases; mean age, SD: 25.6 ¬± 4.4) and 33 demographically similar controls (mean age, SD: 23.2 ¬± 3.7), were included from six clubs. All players underwent a repeated-sprint test, consisting of six 30-meter maximal sprints with 90 seconds of recovery between sprints. Sprint performance was captured using high-speed video-recording and subsequently assessed by a blinded tester to calculate maximal sprint velocity, maximal horizontal force, maximal horizontal power, and mechanical effectiveness.\nResults\nA significant between-group difference was seen in favor of players having a previous hamstring injury over 6 sprints for maximal velocity (mean difference: 0.457 m/s, 95% CI: 0.059-0.849, p = 0.025) and mechanical effectiveness (mean difference: 0.009, 95% CI: 0.001-0.016, p = 0.020).\nConclusion\nRepeated-sprint performance was not impaired in football players with a previous hamstring strain injury; in fact, higher mean maximal sprinting velocity and better mechanical effectiveness were found in players with compared to without a previous hamstring injury. The higher sprinting velocity, which likely increases biomechanical load on the hamstring muscles, in previously injured players may increase the risk of recurrent injuries.\n\r","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"a0b16400f0b4aff95c4c06e19c0b3666","permalink":"https://lasseishoi.netlify.app/publication/2022-02-18-sprint-performance-and-previous-hamstring-injury/","publishdate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-02-18-sprint-performance-and-previous-hamstring-injury/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract\rBackground\nHamstring strain injuries are common in many sports.
