One of these may be from the Second Spectrum, a match video tracking and analytics provider for many major leagues, including the Danish Superliga.\nWhile Second Spectrum provides a basic overview of physical match data across teams and players in the league via their cloud solution, more comprehensive analyses and visualizations require export of the data. Unfortunately, this does not come in a tidy format suitable for analyses, why I saw the need to develop a small R package for transforming the exported csv files into a tidy format to make my life easier.\nIn this blog post I provide a walk through of the data cleaning and manipulation process of the TidySpectrum package.\nA big shout out to the TidyX Screencast by Patrick Ward and Ellis Hughes, who have recorded two excellent videos on how to clean ugly excel files.\nSecond Spectrum gives access to different physical data files, of which I am most interested in the Physical Splits, which essentially provides 5 minute splits of different running metrics for all players at both teams, including aggregated for each team.\nLet us first have a look at the top 50 rows of the csv file as it appear if you import it into R using the read_csv function. In the first few rows you have some meta-data with information on the date and which two teams played each other, followed by some velocity threshold definitions. A few rows later there is an embedded header representing the minute splits followed by TeamA (including metrics) and all players for that particular team (including metrics for each player), and so fourth for TeamB. It is obvious that this is not a data structure/format suited for analyses.\n\r\rSecond Spectrum Split

in elite male footballers from youth to senior level.\nMethods\nWe tested 125 players from the under-13-years (U13) to senior squads of a Danish male professional football club in this cross-sectional design study. Hip adductor and abductor force (in newtons), torque (in newton meters), normalized torque (in newton meters per body mass), and adduction-to-abduction ratio were measured using handheld dynamometry.\nResults\nBetween U‚Äô13 and senior level, adductor force increased by 104%, torque by 127%, and normalized torque by 21%.

Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome is a cause of hip-related pain typically diagnosed in young to middle-aged physically active individuals. It is caused by altered hip joint morphology (i.e., the shape of the bones), which, in the middle-aged to elderly, has been linked to the development of osteoarthritis. Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome is often treated surgically using an arthroscopic procedure. While hip arthroscopy effectively alleviates pain and improves function, less is known about how patients consider their function after surgery and whether factors before surgery can help predict the outcome. In this thesis, you will find five papers with the overarching aim of investigating 1) the influence of hip joint morphology as a precursor for early osteoarthritis, 2) subjective and objective outcomes after hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, and 3) if factors before surgery can help predict how patients end up after surgery.\n\n**Methods**\n\nWe first investigated the associations between different characteristics of hip joint morphology with surgically defined hip cartilage injuries using data from the Danish Hip Arthroscopy Registry (Paper I). Second, we surveyed patients who had undergone hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome with regards to their current symptoms and sports function by asking whether they considered their symptoms as acceptable (141 patients, Paper II) and whether they were able to engage in their pre-injury sport (189 patients, Paper III). Subsequently, we measured objective function ‚Äì hip muscle strength and jump performance ‚Äì in 45 patients who had undergone hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (Paper IV). Finally, we developed and externally temporal validated clinical prediction models to predict a successful or unsuccessful outcome after hip arthroscopy using data from the Danish Hip Arthroscopy Registry (1546 patients, Paper V).\n\n**Results**\n\nSpecific hip joint morphologies were associated with distinct cartilage injury patterns. More severe morphology was associated with a higher risk (4-fold) of severe cartilage injuries. A little more than half of the patients rated their symptoms as unacceptable 1-2 years after hip arthroscopy, while 57 % were engaged in their previous sport activities, yet only 17 % had a performance level comparable to before the onset of hip and groin pain. No differences were found in maximal hip muscle strength or jump performance between the operated and non-operated hip 6-30 months after hip arthroscopy. However, the operated hip displayed less explosiveness for hip flexion. Furthermore, having higher hip extension strength was associated with being engaged in pre-injury sport. By using 26 clinical variables collected prior to hip arthroscopy, it was possible to accurately predict the risk of ending up with an unsuccessful outcome (having unacceptable symptoms) 1 year after hip arthroscopy.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nIn this thesis, we have provided an overview of the role of different bony hip joint morphologies for the risk of cartilage injuries, presented a detailed picture of what patients can expect after hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, and developed and validated a clinical prediction model that can be used in clinical practice to guide if hip arthroscopy is beneficial for the patient. We show that the severity of cam morphology increases the risk of cartilage injuries, suggesting that cartilage injuries may be the underlying pathology in these patients. After hip arthroscopy, patients can expect to get better, but up to half of all patients continue to rate their symptoms as unacceptable, and only a few can resume sporting activities without hip and groin problems. By using a clinical prediction model based on typical clinical variables collected prior to surgery, the orthopedic surgeon can estimate the likelihood of the patient ending up with unacceptable symptoms one-year after surgery. This information can be used to guide the decision of whether hip arthroscopy is beneficial for the individual patient and, thus, can help improve hip arthroscopy outcomes in the future.","tags":null,"title":"Explore and download PhD Thesis","type":"event"},{"authors":["Mathias Nielsen","Kristian Thorborg","Kasper Krommes","Kasper Thornton","Per Holmich","Juan Penalver","Lasse Ish√∏i"],"categories":null,"content":"\r\rAbstract\rObjectives\nTo compare long-lever squeeze testing using the ForceFrame and the Copenhagen 5-Second Squeeze test (5SST) for assessment of hip adduction strength and provoked groin pain in elite male soccer players.\nDesign\nCross-sectional study.\nSetting\nPre-season testing at facilities of a Danish professional 1st tier soccer club and academy.\nParticipants\nElite male soccer players (n ¬º 83, mean age; 16 ¬± 2.7 years) from U13, U14, U15, U17, U19 and senior teams cleared for full training and match participation.\nMain outcome measures\nMaximum isometric hip adduction strength (Nm/kg) and provoked groin pain (NRS 0-10).\nResults\nHip adduction strength was 16% lower in the ForceFrame.
